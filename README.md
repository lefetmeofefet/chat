A chat.

## Running
### Run the server
In server folder, execute `run-docker.sh`

This runs docker compose up, which runs the db and server.

### Run the client
In client folder, execute `run-docker.sh`

This runs the client in a new terminal window.

# How does it work
Let's consider a typical scenario of two users interacting.
* server starts up, initializing a db connection and empty list of clients
* user A registers: 
  * user is created in db 
  * session_id is generated in backed, stored in the db and sent back to client
  * following requests will require a valid session_id, which will expire at some point in the future
* user A chooses room
  * room name is sent to server. server remembers the room for the client.
  * server sends the client a list of messages history in the room, if there is one
* user A sends a message:
  * server broadcasts the message to all the clients in the room (just the sender for now)
  * sender (user A) receives message and displays it on screen.
  * sender will send a "seen_message" request to server
  * server will broadcast the "seen_by" to everyone else in the room
* user B logs in:
  * user is retrieved from db
  * new session_id is generated and sent to client
  * if the same user is already logged in, the other session is ended because session_id has changed
* user B chooses room
  * server sends user B the list of messages in the room
  * per message, user B will send "seen_message" if he didn't see the message previously (if message.seen_by doesn't include him)
  * server will broadcast the "seen_by" to everyone else in the room

Below is an architecture diagram of the system:

## Known issues
* when a message comes in while there is some text typed in the terminal, the text is overriden. This has to do with the terminal input being the same as any piece of text in the terminal, and it should be fixed by copying the typed message, displaying the incoming message, pasting the typed message below and moving the cursor to the end of the typed text.
* when recoverable errors occur, the client disconnects instead of retrying. recoverable scenarios: session is expired (should re-login), server is unreachable (should retry / type in new server address).
* resizing the terminal screen scrambles the layout into oblivion, because the cli depends on a constant number of characters in the terminal window. fix? think about it
* you can't get out of rooms :(
